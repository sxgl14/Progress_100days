    <ol>
        <li>In a pressure cooker, seal the brisket previously seasoned with salt, pepper and cumin. When it is golden, remove and add the onion, paprika, skinless tomato and garlic, all finally chopped, and cook very well until soft.</li>
        <li>Return the meat to the pot, add the Worcestershire sauce, water or beef broth until it covers the meat a little. Also add the cilantro branch, a little more cumin, salt and pepper. Cover the pressure cooker and cook for 1 and a half hours.</li>
        <li>When the meat is ready, shred it with your hands or a fork and return it to the pot so that it absorbs more of the flavor of the rest of the ingredients. Reserve until serving time.</li>
        <li>For the beans, let them soak the night before, when preparing them add plenty of water to a pressure cooker, add the beans with a little onion and salt, and let cook for 1 hour and a half.</li>
        <li>In a frying pan, prepare a sauce with the onion, red pepper, finely chopped garlic and grated parsley. Then, add it to the beans (if they have a lot of water you can remove a little), cook over medium heat until they thicken a little, adjust the flavor with salt, cumin and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan with oil at medium temperature, fry the banana slices until golden.</li>
        <li>Finally, serve the Venezuelan Creole pavilion with black beans, shredded meat, white rice and banana slices.</li>
